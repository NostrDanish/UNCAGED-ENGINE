# Search Index Protocol (SIP-01) — Draft v1

> **Status:** project/protocol draft. This is **not** an official NIP. It is a
> shared, app-independent contract that any search engine, crawler, relay, or
> fork may implement. If the ecosystem adopts it, it may be proposed as a NIP.
> This repository contains the reference implementation
> (`src/lib/webIndex.ts`, `src/lib/indexerIdentity.ts`).

**One shared decentralized index. Many independent indexers. Many independent
search nodes. Many independent search engines. No mandatory identity. No single
owner.**

---

## 1. Purpose

Define a stable, interoperable Nostr representation of an **indexed web
document** so that:

- any crawler/indexer can publish observations of web pages;
- any relay can store and replicate them;
- any search node can consume them and build a local index;
- any search engine can rank/filter them however it wants;

without depending on Google, Bing, a single company, one crawler, one relay,
one search engine, or one signing key.

## 2. Scope

The protocol describes **what an indexed web document looks like on Nostr** —
nothing else. It does **not** define:

- ranking algorithms (that belongs to search engines);
- moderation/filtering policy (that belongs to search nodes/engines);
- application branding or per-app features;
- user identity or reputation (optional higher layers);
- NIP-50 search syntax (a *query mechanism*, not a document format).

An event answers one question: **"Indexer `pubkey` observed this web document
at this time, and here is its lightweight metadata."**

## 3. Event kind

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Kind | **39697** (addressable, 30000–39999 range) |
| Name | Web Index Observation |
| Mutability | Addressable: one live slot per `(pubkey, d)`. Re-indexing the same URL replaces the indexer's previous observation. Historical immutability is intentionally NOT provided by the core event; archivists may keep superseded versions. |

The kind is currently unused by any official NIP (verified against the kind
registry at time of writing). It is a draft allocation for this protocol.

### Why addressable (not regular/immutable)

- A crawler re-observing a page should update, not spam a new immutable event
  every crawl — relay storage stays bounded.
- **Multiple independent indexers** observing the same URL naturally produce
  multiple events with the **same `d` tag and different pubkeys** — this is
  the core of the "7 independent indexers saw this page" model. Search nodes
  group by `d` and count distinct authors.
- Tradeoff: no built-in observation history. Acceptable for v1 — search nodes
  that want history can archive every version they see.

### Why not NIP-78 (kind 30078)

NIP-78 is explicitly for applications "that do not care about
interoperability" — the opposite of a shared index. Kind 30078 is fine for
genuinely app-specific data (this template uses it for user-curated community
submissions, see NIP.md §2), but it is not the shared document protocol.

## 4. Document identity

Three distinct identities, kept separate on purpose:

| Identity | Field | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| URL identity | `d` tag | Stable slot for the **normalized URL** (see §8). All indexers observing the same normalized URL produce the same `d`. |
| Canonical URL | `u` tag | The page's preferred URL after canonical/redirect resolution. Defaults to the normalized URL when unknown. |
| Content identity | `x` tag | Hash of the observed content/metadata (see §9). Changes when the page meaningfully changes. |
| Observation | the event itself | One indexer's signed view at `created_at`. |

`d = "widx:" + lowercase hex of SHA-256(normalized_url), truncated to 32 hex chars`.

The `widx:` namespace prefix prevents collisions with other addressable
schemas a reader might encounter.

## 5. Event structure

```json
{
  "kind": 39697,
  "pubkey": "<indexer pubkey, hex>",
  "created_at": 1754650000,
  "content": "{\"title\":\"Example Page\",\"description\":\"Short description.\",\"image\":\"https://example.com/og.jpg\"}",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "widx:9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0c55ad015"],
    ["u", "https://example.com/page"],
    ["t", "nostr"],
    ["t", "privacy"],
    ["l", "en"],
    ["x", "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855"],
    ["v", "1"],
    ["published", "1754600000"],
    ["alt", "Web index observation: Example Page"]
  ],
  "sig": "..."
}
```

## 6. Required fields

| Field | Location | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `d` | tag | Exactly one. `widx:` + 32 lowercase hex chars. MUST equal the SHA-256-derived id of the `u` tag's normalized form (§8). Readers SHOULD verify. |
| `u` | tag | Exactly one. The canonical URL. MUST pass the URL allowlist (§12). |
| `title` | content JSON | 1–300 chars after trim. |
| `v` | tag | Exactly one. Schema version. This document defines `"1"`. |
| `alt` | tag | Exactly one (NIP-31-style human description). |

## 7. Optional fields

| Field | Location | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `description` | content JSON | ≤ 1000 chars. Plain text, no markup. |
| `image` | content JSON | https URL to a representative image. |
| `t` | tag | 0–8 lowercase topic tags (e.g. `["t","nostr"]`). Relay-filterable — this is how topical engines (Foodstr, DeveloperSearch) slice the index without a new kind. |
| `l` | tag | ISO 639-1 language code (follows NIP-23/24 `l` convention). |
| `x` | tag | Content hash (§9), NIP-94 `x` convention. |
| `published` | tag | Unix seconds — page's own claimed publication time, if known. |
| `source` | tag | Indexer software identifier, e.g. `0xsearchstr-web/1`. Informational only; the `pubkey` is the real indexer identity. |

Optional fields MUST NOT be required to interpret the event. A consumer that
only understands `d`, `u`, `title`, `v` has a working index entry.

Application-specific extensions (e.g. a Presearchstr staking signal) go in
**additional tags or separate events referencing this one** — never by
changing the meaning of core fields.

## 8. URL normalization

Before hashing into `d`, URLs MUST be normalized:

1. Parse; reject anything not `http://` or `https://`.
2. Lowercase scheme and host; strip a leading `www.` from the host.
3. Remove default ports (`:80` http, `:443` https).
4. Remove the fragment (`#…`) entirely.
5. Remove known tracking parameters: `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`,
   `utm_term`, `utm_content`, `fbclid`, `gclid`, `dclid`, `mc_cid`, `mc_eid`,
   `igshid`, `ref_src`, `spm`, `si`. **All other query parameters are
   preserved** — many are semantically required (`?id=`, `?page=`, `?q=`).
6. Sort remaining query parameters alphabetically by key.
7. Remove a trailing `/` from the path (except the bare root `/`).
8. Re-encode: `URL.toString()` after the above.

The canonical implementation is `normalizeIndexUrl()` in
`src/lib/webIndex.ts`, covered by tests. Implementations MUST produce
byte-identical `d` tags for the same page or deduplication breaks.

## 9. Content identity (`x` tag)

`x = lowercase hex SHA-256` of the UTF-8 string:

```
title + "\n" + description
```

of the **observed** metadata (before any consumer-side truncation). It is a
cheap agreement signal: two indexers with the same `d` and same `x` observed
the same content; same `d` different `x` means the page changed or indexers
disagree — both useful to search nodes. It is **not** a hash of the full HTML
(crawlers may add a separate extension tag for that).

## 10. Indexer identity

Every observation is signed by the indexer's Nostr keypair — the `pubkey` IS
the indexer identity. Requirements:

- Indexer keys are **generated locally, stored locally, never uploaded**.
- Indexer keys are **separate from any personal Nostr identity**. Automatic
  indexing never uses the logged-in user's key.
- Indexer keys are **replaceable**: regenerating creates a new indexer.
  Old events remain signed by the old key and keep their history; reputation
  does not transfer.
- No single central signing key is authoritative. A server-side crawler or
  autosigner is just one more independent indexer among the browsers.

## 11. Versioning

`v` versions the **schema**, not any application. `v = 1` is this document.
Consumers MUST ignore events with unknown `v` (or attempt best-effort parsing
of the fields they know). Publishers MUST NOT change the meaning of an
existing field without bumping `v`.

## 12. Security & URL allowlist

- `u` and `image` MUST be `https://` (or `http://` for `u`, tolerated but
  ranked lower). `javascript:`, `data:`, `file:`, `vbscript:` etc. MUST be
  rejected at parse AND build time.
- Consumers MUST sanitize all event-sourced strings before DOM use (React
  escaping covers text; URLs additionally pass an allowlist sanitizer).
- Field length caps (§6/§7) are hard limits — drop or truncate overlong input.
- Server-side crawlers fetching these URLs MUST apply SSRF protections
  (no RFC-1918/loopback/link-local/cloud-metadata targets, redirect limits).
  This browser-based reference implementation never fetches indexed URLs
  server-side.
- The protocol carries **no search queries**. An observation event reveals a
  URL + metadata, never who searched for what (§14).

## 13. Relay usage

- Publishers SHOULD publish to 2+ relays. Consumers SHOULD query 2+ and merge
  by event id, grouping by `d`.
- Plain Nostr filters work everywhere: `{ kinds:[39697], '#d':[…] }`,
  `{ kinds:[39697], '#t':['recipe'] }`. NIP-50 `search` is an OPTIONAL
  acceleration on capable relays, never a requirement.
- No relay is the permanent global index. If a relay disappears, the index
  lives on elsewhere.

## 14. Privacy

- **Searching needs no login, no key, no profile.** Reads are unauthenticated.
- **Auto-indexing publishes document observations, never queries.** The event
  contains a URL and its public metadata — nothing about the user whose
  search surfaced it.
- The auto-indexing identity is pseudonymous: it is not cryptographically
  tied to the user's personal Nostr identity. Network observers may still
  correlate IP/timing; the protocol guarantees key separation, not network
  anonymity.

## 15. Compatibility

Kind 39697 is the canonical document index. Earlier app-specific query caches
(e.g. kind 30078 `d:"0xsearchstr:cache:*"`, written by historical 0xSearchstr
deployments) are frozen legacy data: consumers MAY merge them in by
normalized URL, but new document indexing MUST use kind 39697. There is no
flag day — old data keeps working, new data uses this protocol.

## 16. Search node behavior (guidance)

A search node consuming this protocol SHOULD:

1. Subscribe to kind 39697 across several relays.
2. Verify `d` ↔ normalized `u` consistency and `v` support; drop invalid.
3. Group by `d`: distinct `pubkey` count = independent observations.
4. Store locally (inverted index), rank locally, filter locally.
5. Use `x` and `created_at` for freshness/agreement signals.
6. Never treat any single indexer, relay, or engine as authoritative.

## 17. Examples

Minimal valid event (only required fields):

```json
{
  "kind": 39697,
  "content": "{\"title\":\"Example\"}",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "widx:3a6eb0790f39ac87c94f3856b2dd2c5d"],
    ["u", "https://example.com/"],
    ["v", "1"],
    ["alt", "Web index observation: Example"]
  ]
}
```

Full event: see §5.
